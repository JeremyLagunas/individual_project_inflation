# Individual Project - Rising Consumer Prices

## Project Description:
The purpose of this project is to look at different economic indicators to determine whether there are certain indicators which have a relationship with rising consumer prices. My target variables during this project will be the CPI (Consumer Price Index) and the CPI Rate of Change. 

## Project Goals:
- Determine which indicators, if any, have a significant relationship with CPI and CPI rate. 
- Generate a predictive model for both CPI and CPI Rate.

## Project Plan/Outline:
1. Acquire data - I will be acquiring data from the Economic Research website of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis website: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/
2. Prepare data - I will make necessary changes to the data in order to make it easier to read and work with. I will create one dataframe to move forward with my exploration.
3. Explore - I will create visualizations to demonstrate any potential relationship between indicators and target variables and I will perform statistical analyses to determine the significance of these relationships.
4. Model - I will split my data and generate several models to predict CPI and CPI Rate. I will compare these models' performance and decide which one to use on the Test data. I will run the model on the Test data to see it's performance. 
5. Deliver - I will consolidate all relevant work into a Final Report Notebook which will walk through my process from Acquire to Modeling. I will generate a White Paper which will provide my work and insights in an easy to read and access form.
